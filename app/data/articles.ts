Rodriguez, formerly known as Montalban, holds a significant place in Philippine history. During the revolution against Spanish rule in 1898, the town became a key stronghold for Katipuneros. The natural fortress provided by Mt. Pamitinan and Mt. Binacayan served as a sanctuary and meeting place for revolutionaries, including Andres Bonifacio. After the execution of Dr. Jose Rizal in 1896, which galvanized the Filipino fight for independence, several Montalban residents, including Licerio Geronimo (known as General Sergio), Simplicio Inocentes, Gregorio Cruz, Martin Cruz, and others, joined the Katipunan in Cabanatuan to fight for freedom. The town's first chapel, “Pasong Vista,” was erected on land donated by Pantaleon Cruz and later relocated to its current site in front of the town’s cemetery on land donated by Candido Domingo and Alejandra Cruz. During the revolution, this chapel was transformed into a fort but was unfortunately destroyed during the conflict. Later, Emilio Aguinaldo’s forces retreated to Puray in Montalban after defeats in Cavite, culminating in the Battle of Mount Puray in 1897, a significant victory for the revolutionaries. This rich history underscores Montalban’s enduring spirit of patriotism and resilience, a legacy that continues to inspire its residents today.

        content: `

The Municipal Tourism and Cultural Affairs Office (MTCAO) is dedicated to establishing Rodriguez as a premier eco-tourism destination in the CALABARZON region. This vision centers on sustainable tourism that highlights the town’s natural assets—its majestic mountains, pristine rivers, and historic caves—while ensuring their preservation for future generations. A cornerstone of this strategy is the proposed “green corridor” or “linear greenway,” an arterial road-linear park designed to connect key tourism sites, decongest urban areas, and promote compact, environmentally conscious growth. This initiative aligns with the Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) of Rodriguez (2012-2022), which emphasizes protecting environmentally critical areas and fostering agro-economic and tourism development. Rodriguez also participates in the Green Corridor Initiative, a regional program supported by the Department of Tourism to create a network of eco-tourism sites across Rizal province, integrating nature, adventure, and cultural experiences. By promoting responsible hiking, supporting local businesses, and preserving cultural heritage, the MTCAO aims to generate sustainable income and employment opportunities, positioning Rodriguez as a model for eco-tourism in the Philippines.

Nestled in the remote Barangay Puray of Rodriguez, Rizal, Puray Falls—also known as Panas Falls or Tungtong to locals—is a hidden gem that offers a serene escape from the bustling tourist spots like Wawa Dam. Discovered in 2002 by mountain bikers exploring new trails, this multi-tiered waterfall cascades into crystal-clear natural pools surrounded by pristine forest, creating an idyllic setting for swimming and relaxation. The journey to Puray Falls is an adventure in itself, requiring a challenging trek through rugged terrain or a 4x4 ride across approximately 11 river crossings, making it a favorite among thrill-seekers and nature enthusiasts. Unlike the more accessible Wawa Dam, Puray Falls remains relatively untouched, preserving its raw beauty and tranquility. Visitors are rewarded with a peaceful retreat where the sounds of cascading water and the lush greenery provide a perfect backdrop for reconnecting with nature. This hidden paradise is a testament to Rodriguez’s rich natural offerings, inviting those willing to venture off the beaten path to discover its serene beauty.

The festival features a grand parade, known as the Pasayo, showcasing floats and effigies of the mythical titan Bernardo Carpio, alongside street dancing competitions that vividly depict Montalban’s multi-faceted culture. Visitors can immerse themselves in the Agri-Trade Tourism Fair, which highlights local agricultural produce from upland villages, and enjoy nightly Music & Busking in the Park events featuring homegrown musical talents. As Mayor Ronnie Evangelista notes, “This festival is a testament to our rich cultural heritage and the spirit of unity,” making it a must-visit event for those eager to experience the heart and soul of Rodriguez.
